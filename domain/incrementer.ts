/**
 * A counter driven by asynchronous increment commands.
 *
 * `increment` enqueues a command and returns immediately; a background fiber
 * drains the queue and applies each command to an incremental `Metric.Counter`
 * held in the service's own `Metric.MetricRegistry`. `value` reads that
 * counter, so it is *eventually consistent*: right after an `increment` the
 * reported count may still lag the accepted commands, but it converges to
 * their total.
 *
 * The counter is `incremental: true`, so the state can never decrease; the
 * monotonicity invariant is enforced by the metric, not by scattered checks.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
 * import { Incrementer } from "./incrementer.ts";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const incrementer = yield* Incrementer;
 *   yield* incrementer.increment(); // accepted, applied asynchronously
 *   yield* incrementer.increment(4);
 *   // Eventually consistent: yield until the worker has applied both.
 *   let count = yield* incrementer.value;
 *   while (count !== 5) {
 *     yield* Effect.yieldNow;
 *     count = yield* incrementer.value;
 *   }
 *   return count;
 * });
 *
 * const count = await Effect.runPromise(
 *   Effect.provide(program, Incrementer.layer("greeting-count")),
 * );
 * // count === 5
